## About Datastory and the API

Datastory helps organizations build websites and visualization from different data sources. Using the API you can interact with the core aspects of the platform. Here are some examples of what the API makes possible:

1. Define your [data models](/docs/schema)
2. Import [content](/docs/content) and [media files](/docs/content/media)
3. Organize [statistics](/docs/statistics) in [data cubes](/docs/statistics/cubes) and [tables](/docs/tables)
4. Create [visualizations](/docs/visualizations), [websites](/docs/websites) and [pages](/docs/pages)
5. Generate [insights](/docs/insights) from data
6. Explore [open data](/docs/open-data)
