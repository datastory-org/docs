## System fields

All default, and custom content types come with some managed system fields. These fields reflect certain states of your content, such as when it was last updated, or published at.

## Default model fields

These fields are included with all content models you create within Hygraph.

| Field            | Type      | Description                                        |
| ---------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| id               | ID!       | Unique for each content entry                      |
| createdAt        | DateTime! | Timestamp for when the content entry was created   |
| createdBy        | User      | The user who created the content entry             |
| updatedAt        | DateTime! | Timestamp for when the content entry was updated   |
| updatedBy        | User      | The user who last updated the content entry        |
| publishedAt      | DateTime! | Timestamp for when the content entry was published |
| publishedBy      | User      | The user who last published the content entry      |
| documentInStages | [model]   | Query the current document in other stages         |

## User fields

Since the User model is included with every project, it also comes with some predefined fields, as well as all of the system fields above (but not createdBy, updatedBy, and publishedBy).

The User model is part of "user attribution", and is connected with content entries. This connection allows you to see who created, updated, and published content entries.

| Field       | Type      | Description                                      |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| id          | ID!       | The ID of the user                               |
| name        | String!   | The name of the user                             |
| picture     | String    | The profile picture URL                          |
| kind        | UserKind! | The type of user - either MEMBER, PAT, or PUBLIC |
| createdAt   | DateTime! | The created at date and time of the user         |
| updatedAt   | DateTime! | The last updated at date and time of the user    |
| publishedAt | DateTime  | The last published at date and time of the user  |
