## MatchOn Behavior

The `matchOn` parameter can be provided either as a top-level property on the item object, or as a property within the `properties` array. If both are present, the top-level property takes precedence.

For example, when using `matchOn: "iso2"`, you can provide the ISO code either as:
```typescript
{
  "iso2": "SE",  // top-level property
  "class_id": "Country",
  // ...
}
```
or as:
```typescript
{
  "class_id": "Country",
  "properties": [
    { "id": "iso2", "statements": [{ "data_value": "SE" }] }  // property in array
  ]
}
```

## Property Update Behavior

When updating items, the API handles properties in the following ways:

- Properties not included in the update request are preserved
- Properties included with statements are updated with the new values
- Properties included with an empty statements array are deleted

Example of property deletion:
```typescript
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "sweden",
      "class_id": "Country",
      "properties": [
        { "id": "population", "statements": [] } // This will delete the population property
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Relationship Property Format

When creating or updating relationship properties, you must provide the explicit
ID of the related item in the `data_value` field. This is different from other
property types that use a direct value.

Example of a relationship property:
```typescript
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "stockholm",
      "class_id": "City",
      "properties": [
        {
          "id": "country",
          "statements": [
            { "data_value": { "id": "sweden" } } // Reference to the sweden item
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

> **Note:** If the referenced item doesn't exist in the database, a foreign key
violation error will be raised.
