## Items

To retrieve items of a particular type, send a POST request to the /items/query endpoint. The collection is paginated, so make sure to iterate over all the pages if you need every record in the collection!

The following table contains the list of all the possible arguments, along with their type, description and examples values.

Pro tip: in case of any doubts you can always inspect the network calls that the CMS interface is doing, as it's using the Content Management API as well!
